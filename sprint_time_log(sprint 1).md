## Project Summary

### Team Project (Group Project)

During the Sprint, we dedicated one full class period (1 hour) each week to discuss and develop the Group Project. Outside of class, additional time was spent discussing technical details and assigning responsibilities. I was responsible for creating and managing the GitHub repository for our team, setting up the development environment, and ensuring everything was operational. All project functionality was tested and confirmed working by the end of the Sprint.

### Personal Project (Game Score Tracker)

This was a command-line project built using Python and SQLite. It allows users to manage game scores with full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). A stretch feature was added that enables filtering scores by date range. The project was developed independently outside of class, including time spent reading documentation, troubleshooting SQL, and testing the application. Total time dedicated to this project met and exceeded the 10-hour requirement.
